     --header "Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13" \
		http://example.com:80/

 curl -i -N -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" -H "Host: echo.websocket.org" -H "Origin: https://www.websocket.org" https://echo.websocket.org
 curl -i -N -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" -H "Host: echo.websocket.org" -H "Origin: http://www.websocket.org" http://echo.websocket.org

 Those flags say:
  - Return headers in the output
  - Don¡¯t buffer the response
  - Set a header that this connection needs to upgrade from HTTP to something else
  - Set a header that this connection needs to upgrade to a WebSocket connection
  - Set a header to define the host (required by later WebSocket standards)
  - Set a header to define the origin of the request (required by later WebSocket standards)
