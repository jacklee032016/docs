What is Branch
===========================
Branch is used to develop new function or fix bugs when a matural version is usable;

Default, ``master`` is branch for code base;

Other Branches are created, and developed, then merged into ``master``; ``master`` also can be merged into other branches;


Create and Use Branch
===========================
Create and use 

::

  git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME : create and use BRANCH_NAME


Change working space to one branch

::

  git checkout BRANCH_NAME|master : use BRANCH_NAME or ``master``
 
  git branch : list branches
